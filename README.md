<h3>This is a small project designed for me to get my feet wet with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</h3>
The site communicates with a firebase database, updating the "Message of the Day", instaneously for all to see. This is exciting because once I get this functionality down pat, I will be able to create much bigger and better things! 

Thanks for visiting!
